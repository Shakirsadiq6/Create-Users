# Parameters to be considered.
1. The information attribute of a user will be Name, Age, Sex, Email, Username and Password.
2. Email and Username must be unique.
3. Password must contain at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 special character and 1 digit. The minimum length of alphanumeric passwords should be 8.
